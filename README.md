# StallMate-Restroom-Kiosk

## What is StallMate?
StallMate is a kiosk created with the intent of adding services and convenience to users' experience in public restrooms. This repository contains information and design files for the finalized prototype. 

Services offered: 
<ul> 
  <li> Stall availability indicator </li>
  <li> Maintenance request </li>
  <li> Item vending </li> 
  <li> Contactless payment </li> 
  <li> Mesh networking capabilites </li> 
</ul>

## Motivations 
StallMate is a response to aspects of the public restroom experience which we felt could be improved. Based on our survey responses, many respondents voiced priorities for a clean, private and convenient experience. This preferred experience is hindered by common issues, such as: 

<ul> 
  <li> Toilets not functioning </li>
  <li> Restrooms needing cleaning </li> 
  <li> Not knowing which stall is unoccupied, and associated issues </li> 
</ul>

We felt that our solution, a kiosk, could address these issues while providing additional value through product vending.
